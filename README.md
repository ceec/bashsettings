# bashsettings

## .bash_profile 

### colors
Not needed but changes colors for different parts of the prompt

### change command prompt

uses  /git-settings.sh which is a file copied from here https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/contrib/completion/git-prompt.sh



There are instructions at the top of git-settings.sh that recreates what I have done as well.
